In this paper the authors proposed a novel scene graph generation method. Scene graph is a structural representation that captures objects and their semantic relationships, whose value has been proven in a wide range of visual task.  

Based on Region Proposal Network, this work perform approximate inference with GRUs on the complete graph whose nodes are the object proposal boxes. Then the model with produce predictions of the object label of boxes, the bounding box offsets of the boxes and the relationships between all boxes. This procedure utilizes the interaction information between all proposal boxes. The experiments shows that their method outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on Visual Genome and NYU Depth v2 dataset.
